"""Builds the explicit, grid-grounded geometric model of a floor plan: wall
IDs + intersection graph, dimension-to-wall resolution, and cleaned/merged
text labels — meant as an LLM-ready set of facts/constraints for the
compliance reasoning step, not a loose blob.

Ported from symbol_lab (a standalone research activity that iterated this
design against a real plan, including two real bugs caught and fixed live:
mixing mm+Y-flipped wall coordinates with raw-pixel OCR positions silently
corrupts every distance calculation, and a "same row" text-clustering check
based on image-size-derived grid cells instead of the OCR tokens' own text
height let two different lines merge incorrectly). See symbol_lab/README.md
for the full history. Geometric symbol matching (candidate regions vs a PDF
symbol library) was tried there and DROPPED — too many confident-but-wrong
matches, and it missed the plan's actual staircase entirely. Subcomponent
identification here comes from Mistral vision instead (see guidance.py's
identify_subcomponents_via_mistral).

Runs entirely in the SAME raw pixel space (Y-down) that extract_geometry()
and run_ocr() already produce — this must run BEFORE pipeline.convert()
calls apply_scale() (which converts to mm AND flips Y for DXF export), or
the coordinate-space bug above reproduces here too.
