"""Deterministic door/window detection from architectural drawing convention.

Standard plan symbols, which this encodes directly:

* A **door** is a quarter-circle swing arc plus a straight leaf. The arc bulges
  *perpendicular, away from* the wall into the room it opens onto.
* A **window** is a thin box drawn *inside* the wall band — parallel thin lines
  collinear with the wall, never bulging out of it. A wide window is drawn as
  several collinear blocks, so adjacent blocks on the same wall are merged into
  one opening.

That perpendicular-bulge-vs-collinear distinction is what separates the two, and
it is a property of the convention rather than of any particular drawing: every
threshold here is a ratio of the image's own dimensions or of the local wall
thickness, so nothing is tuned to a specific plan.

Unlike a vision model's read, the widths produced here are real pixel geometry,
so once a scale is recovered they become actual clear-width figures that can be
checked against a regulation.
